OVERVIEW

  This is libcidr, a library to handle manipulating CIDR netblocks in
  IPv4 and IPv6 in a host of ways.  It's useful for parsing textual
  representations of addresses and blocks, comparing blocks in various
  ways, and outputting them in different formats.


INSTALLATION

  Steps to install (this needs to be written)


ROADMAP

  Here's a quick overview of the pieces of this dist.  See README files
  in the various subdirs for more information about them.

  - docs/    - The documentation for libcidr, in various formats.
  - include/ - The public header file which will be installed for
  	           programs using libcidr to #include, defining the various
  	           interfaces and flags.
  - src/     - The actual source for libcidr, as well as various examples
  	           and test programs.


SUPPORT

  libcidr is intended to be pretty self-explanatory, particularly with
  the aid of the example programs.  It's also very well documented, with
  the full reference manual explaining the calling conventions and usage
  of the various functions.  And, I like to think the source is generally
  pretty readable in extremis.  However, if you have further questions or
  suggestions, please feel free to email me.
