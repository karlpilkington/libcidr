libcidr docs

  This directory contains the various bits of documentation that describe
  libcidr.


  - libcidr.3 is a quick little manpage that provides a summary of the
    functions, their calling convention, and a short description of what
    they do.  It's not meant to be more than a handy reference if you
    need a function name or prototype quickly.
  
  - reference/ contains the libcidr reference manual, which fully
    documents each of the functions, along with suggestions for use and
    any surprises or gotchas in their use.  It's in a variety of formats,
    all generated from the SGML source.  This uses the codelibrary DTD
    <http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/projects/sgml/codelibrary/>
    which I originally developed for libpostal <http://libpostal.sf.net/>
    and which is designed specifically for documenting libraries.
