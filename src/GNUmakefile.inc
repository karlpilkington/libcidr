# We generally want to use C[89]9.  However, some things (like strdup())
# aren't in the standard, though they're essentially universal, and I
# can't be arsed implementing them manually.  Also, some systems get very
# strict about limiting with C99 (Fedora Core, for instance, doesn't
# expose getopt() in unistd.h with -std=c[89]9).  As a stopgap, set
# -std=c99, but override it by requesting X/Open and SUS extensions
# (which includes POSIX 200112).  We could use -std=gnu99 here too, as
# the GNU extensions include what we care about, but that probably drifts
# us too far in the direction of gcc-centricism.
